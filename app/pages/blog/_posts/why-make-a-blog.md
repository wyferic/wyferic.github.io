Is being alive a blessing and a privilege? I have a roof over my head, food on my plate, friends that care, and a family that loves. However, one problem with living is dying. I lose the roof over my head, the food on my plate, my friends that care, and a family that loves. Also, I will lose myself. My past, present, and future. Gone. Everything I have, loved, and love. Gone. 

## But Why Make a Blog?

This blog holds my unhinged thoughts at 3 AM, my university assignments otherwise deleted, and my desire to document my life. If someone wishes to know me better, my blog offers stories from parts of my life. My blog showcases my friends and family, my past and present, and all the other crap otherwise forgotten. 

If no one wishes to know me better, that is ok. My blog also serves as a personal reminder that I have stories to cherish and stories to look forward to.
